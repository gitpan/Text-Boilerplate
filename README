NAME
    Text::Boilerplate - format a script's output without programming


INSTALLATION

        Unpack the distribution file, then from inside that directory
        type:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            make install


DESCRIPTION

    Boilerplates let you separate what a script does from what its
    output looks like, using a simple mark-up language which is easy
    for non- programmers to learn.  The boilerplate document can be
    stored in a separate file, making maintenance far simpler.  Using
    Boilerplates can make creating and maintaining dynamic web pages
    and e-mail messages much easier.

SYNOPSIS
           use Text::Boilerplate;

           # Create a Boilerplate from a text string
           $boiler = new Text::Boilerplate $text;

           # Create a Boilerplate by loading a file
           $boiler = Text::Boilerplate->load($filename);

           # Create a Boilerplate by loading from a filehandle
           $boiler = Boilerplate->load(\*FILEHANDLE);

           # Fill in all tags in a Boilerplate
           print STDOUT $boiler->fill({
               'Tag Name'  => $value,
               'Tag Name2' => $value,
           });

VERSION NOTES:

The current version of Boilerplate has been working well for me for the past few years. However, I've recently
had an epiphany which will lead to its complete redesign. The above tags are guaranteed to work, though.
